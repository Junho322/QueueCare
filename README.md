# McHacks 2025 - Winning Project
**QueueCare** by Jun Ho Oh, Jiwoong Choi, Shayan Yamanidouzi Sorkhabi, Danny Farkouh

**Inspiration**
An immense amount of people come to the hospital's emergency room suffering from the horrible waiting line experience.
Our teammates, having experienced this waiting line, have decided to provide a solution to this overlooked problem.
In improving the patient's experience in the waiting queue, we wish to improve transparency and emotionally support the patients.

**What does it do?**
QueueCare shows real-time queue updates, wait times, and triage status.
It offers the patients to choose the symptoms they believe they have to generate an informative and transparent message, keeping them engaged.

**How did we build it?**
Our team used Gumloop to take the data from the API given and redirected it into GPT 4.0 to use this generated output which was used as text to generate client information.
Additionally, this data was used to generate a progression bar for the waiting queue.

**Looking back...**
We created a functional solution to ease ER stress with a scalable and practical approach that combines transparency and support. 
Although we could not implement all the desired features in time, we were able to come up with a functioning website.
We learned the importance of privacy of the patients and how to support the people going through this dreadful experience of waiting.

**What's next for QueueCare?**
Weâ€™ll refine features, add languages, gamify the experience, and pilot it in real ERs to improve and measure impact. 
We also plan on adding stress/boredom releasing features such as displaying mediation, exercise suggestion, and stretch suggestion videos.
